#essential computer science questions.

1-How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Creating "user stories" is like writing short, simple stories about what the users want. For example, "As a player, I want to save my game so I can continue later." 
This helps you understand what the user needs in a straightforward way and gives you clear goals to work on when making your program. It also helps you stay focused on what’s most important to the users.

2-How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? 
My approach to developing programs starts with building a simple, functional foundation and then gradually enhancing it. For example, when I first started programming, I created a basic rock-paper-scissors game. Initially, the program only worked if the player entered "rock," "paper," or "scissors," and didn't account for any other input. I focused on getting the core functionality right before worrying about additional features or handling edge cases.

Moving forward, I hope to incorporate Agile processes into my development work, particularly the principles of incremental development and continuous feedback. By starting with a minimal viable product and iteratively improving it based on feedback, I can ensure that each version of the program is better than the last. This approach allows for flexibility, quick adaptation to changes, and a steady progression towards a more complete and polished final product.


3-What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? 
i think being a good team member in software development means collaborating effectively, communicating clearly, and contributing to the team's goals. It's about being reliable, meeting deadlines, and helping others when needed.
